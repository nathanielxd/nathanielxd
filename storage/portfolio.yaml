    Lan Chat is a server-less local network chat app using TCP/UDP packets, supporting text,
    image, file sharing, client discovery, and a clean UI. Finding it on Google Play,
    it sits at over 5000 installs and was built using a handcrafted LAN framework for heartbeat recognition,
    custom names, and text messages in local packets.


    This app is one of the first personal projects I have worked on, and it was initially meant to
    allow me to quickly share data on the network, from my phone to my PC, for example. It was also a fun way to implement
    new knowledge about local networks into an app.


    The project is open source and can be directly downloaded to your Android device through Google Play.
    Documentation on how it was built and figured out to include functionality such as file sharing
    and network detection can be found on GitHub.

    Lethologica is an easy-to-use, beautiful dictionary app that allows users to query and save words into a vocabulary list stored on their devices.


    Featuring smart auto-suggestion, offline storage and Material 3-based theming,
    this project's conception came from the idea of how complicated most vocabulary apps are,
    and I wanted something that I could quickly open up while reading a book or studying.


    The app uses a free dictionary API and imposes a clean, structured architecture that allows it to be expanded anytime.

    Tapline is a fully-fledged brewing experience featuring recipe editors, calculators and a brewing assistant
    to help you make the most fresh and delicious beer.


    This project taught me how to develop an entire app from start to finish.
    Everything from concept and design to development and publishing has been hand-crafted, allowing me to explore some of my hobbies.
